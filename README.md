# Node Express Handlebars- Burger App

## Description
This application lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat. Once the user submits a burger's name, the app displays the burger on the left side of the page, with a 'Devour' button, which moves the burger to the right hand side of the page. This app stores every burger in a database, whether devoured or not. The purpose of the application is to use MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars, and a homemade ORM while following the MVC design pattern.


Deployed application can be found [here](https://burger-app-12-3.herokuapp.com/):.
